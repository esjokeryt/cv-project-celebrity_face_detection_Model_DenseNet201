ðŸ“Œ CV Project â€“ Multi-Class Image Classification with Transfer Learning
This project is a computer vision pipeline designed for multi-class image classification using transfer learning and fine-tuning. The dataset includes 16 distinct classes (from -1 to 14), and the model is trained and evaluated based on accuracy, F1 score, and Top-2 accuracy.

ðŸ“‚ Contents
Data loading and preprocessing

Label encoding and one-hot encoding

Transfer learning using pretrained networks (EfficientNet)

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

Scikit-learn

NumPy

Matplotlib

ðŸ“Š Model Training Steps
Configuration Setup
Define batch size, learning rate, input shape, and other training parameters.

Data Preparation

Load images and labels.

Encode labels using LabelEncoder.

Apply one-hot encoding for categorical output.

Splitting Dataset

Split the data into training and validation sets using stratified sampling.

Model Architecture

Use a pretrained EfficientNet model (e.g., EfficientNetB0).

Freeze base layers initially.

Add custom classification head.

Training Phase 1 â€“ Feature Extraction

Train only the custom layers.

Apply callbacks: ModelCheckpoint, ReduceLROnPlateau, and EarlyStopping.

Training Phase 2 â€“ Fine-Tuning

Unfreeze top layers of the base model.

Re-compile with a smaller learning rate.

Continue training to improve performance.

ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy

Weighted F1 Score

Top-2 Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report

ðŸ§ª Final Prediction & Submission
Load and preprocess test images.

Predict class probabilities using the trained model.

Decode predicted labels (from one-hot back to original label).

Save the submission file in CSV format for competition or evaluation.
